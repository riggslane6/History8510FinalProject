# History8510FinalProject
My final project for the HIST 8510 course

While I have learned how to code **somewhat**, there are likely to be mistakes and I am likely to make ~~revisions~~. 

Because I am interested in the border, this project will look at a border dataset of my choosing. 

**Thanks for a __great__ semester, Dr. R!**
